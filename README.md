# API for Colleen-fletcher.com

## A Headless CMS built for a Gatsby Static Site.

This API uses (Strapi)[https://strapi.io/] to bootstrap login/registration and a
slick user interface. I built as close to a drag-n-drop editor as I could for my
mom and her employees to built out site pages, sales pages, and blog posts as
quickly and efficiently as possible, while keeping the API under our control for
security (and fun!).
